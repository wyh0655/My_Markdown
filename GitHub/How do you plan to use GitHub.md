想申请到这个学生包，GitHub要先绑定一下学校的邮箱，传送门
https://github.com/settings/emails

添加好邮箱后，进入上面那个GitHub教育页面，点击Get the pack.

填写好个人信息，选择学校的邮箱，我是填写的真实姓名，学校名称包括中文和英文。

最后这个就是应该好好写一写的东西了。因为写的比较多，所以一次就通过了审核，不过BUCT的邮箱真是醉了，把申请成功的邮箱放到垃圾邮件分类里了，导致我以为没有申请成功。速度快的话大概一小时就能收到申请成功的邮件。

I plan to use GitHub for a lot of things. For me it is not only something that version controls my side projects but a lot more than that.

1. GitHub provides one user page and unlimited project pages. I will use the user/organization page to host a website about me. I will push the code to GitHub and make my website live with version control. 
2. Try to use more of command line and less of GitHub GUI.  This will make me learn some Git.
3. I will push my projects on GitHub. If the repository is public people will contribute to my code and then will collaborated coding I can turn my minor side project into an awesome project which is being used by people. The feel will be amazing.
4. I can use GitHub to have a list of books that I want to read, a list of anything actually. Markdown makes things very easy and clean.
5. Follow people, I feel, i can learn something from their activity and if I want to use GitHub as social network.

That's all I plan to use GitHub.Thanks.
